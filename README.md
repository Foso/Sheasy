## Introduction
The goal is to write an open source app that makes it super easy to share files from one device to another

It's a hobby project i started to learn about Kotlin, React(Kotlin-JS) and Ktor. 
At this time, this app is in an early stage (work-in-progressüë∑). I never worked with Ktor or Kotlin-React before and i'm still learning. Please keep that in my mind when you see parts in the code that don't follow best pratices (yet).



## üé® Features
A few of the things you can do with Sheasy:
- download apks
