Sheasy Privacy Policy

Sheasy is a Free and Open Source application.
It has no ads and no intention in profit from you in any manner.

One may obtain its source code here: https://github.com/Foso/Sheasy

The idea of this app is to help YOU to share YOUR data with whoever YOU want.

In order to do so, it needs some permissions.

For example: In order to share the data on your SD CARD, it needs permissions to read the SD CARD.
And in order to share you contacts, it needs permissions to read your contacts.

All it does is create an HTTP server with a link. Whoever you share this link will access your data.
I, the developer,  don't have access to the link you create. The app does not phone home.
The app does not even has analytics, so I can not even know if you open my app or not.

If you are not satisfied with this Privacy policy, please delete the app immediately.
